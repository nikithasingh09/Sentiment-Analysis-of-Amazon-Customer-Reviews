This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze sentiment from Amazon product reviews.
By using various Python libraries, the project processes raw review data, extracts meaningful features, and classifies reviews as either positive or negative.

Features

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove punctuation, convert text to lowercase, and eliminate stop words.
Text Preprocessing: Tokenization and stemming of review text.

Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical features using Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF).

Model Building: Train models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM for sentiment classification.

Model Evaluation: Measure accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.

Visualization: Visualize results with confusion matrices and graphs for easy interpretation.

Technologies Used

Python: The programming language used for this project.

pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

scikit-learn: For machine learning algorithms, model building, and evaluation.

nltk: For natural language processing tasks such as tokenization and stop word removal.

matplotlib/seaborn: For data visualization and plotting evaluation metrics.
